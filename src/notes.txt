Thing to add for polishing:
- animate on scroll

Bugs that need fixing:
- When clicked on the router to send user to another page, page loads approximetely on the position on the previous
  page instead of going to the top

- On mobile ver, translateY is bugged and the dropdown menu, while not shown, still takes up space. |solved|

- There is bug in the code for nav bar dropdown that causes react app to freeze and turn white, 
  that's due to #navLink constantly being null for some reason.
  Update: I think it's due to using DOM incorectly and you really cant access it that way in react. That's what 
  dudes at stack overflow said

- image prop for ChildCard component doesn't work |solved|
